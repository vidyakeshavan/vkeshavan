             <!-- If the fedora-on-vacation look immediately
              gave you <i> "Designer with Roots in Marketing & Analytics
                 Committed to Making Digital Products You'd Actually Use" </i> vibes, 
              then look no further. My work here is done. For all the skeptics, 
              let me bring you up to speed on how I got here. 
         -->


              <!-- <br> <br> -->

              <!-- It's as simple as this: If my design practice can make complicated 
              information and services more accessible to users as effectively as the way <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=27HIPU7tUaY&feature=youtu.be&t=4">Anthony Bourdain can use 
                three-day-old halibut</a> to explain what a Collateralized Debt Obligation is, then I've more than done my job.
                <br> <br> -->
                 I focus on user experience and digital product design, though I began my
                career planning digital marketing initiatives for <a href="https://www.slate.com">Slate Magazine</a> and <a href="https://www.wsj.com">The Wall Street Journal.</a>
                 There, I discovered how powerful well designed information can be if it can inspire action and change. 
                 
                 
                  With a masters in <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mps-communication-design/">
                    Product & Communication Design from Parsons</a> under my belt, I'm committed to transforming and simplifying
                    complicated information and services into something more human-centered and accessible.

              <br> <br>
              I'm also proud to say that I've designed and developed
              this site myself. Although coffee, supermarket sushi (I'm not
              proud of it either), and long dramatic sighs had a
              significant hand in its creation. I can tell you all about that over some coffee. And perhaps sushi.
