              If the fedora-on-vacation look immediately
              gave you <i> "Designer with Roots in Marketing & Analytics
                  with a Promise to Make Digital Products You'd Actually Use" </i> vibes, 
              then look no further. My work here is done. For all the skeptics, 
              let me bring you up to speed on how I got here. 


              <br> <br>
              
              After two wonderful stints at 
              <a href="https://www.slate.com/"> Slate Magazine </a> and  
              <a href="https://www.wsj.com/"> The Wall Street Journal, </a>
              I finally had the  opportunity to shift my energy
               from the analytical to the creative at Parsons School of Design, where I recently 
               completed my <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mps-communication-design/">
                masters</a> in Communication Design.

               <br> <br>

              To me, the magic of design lies in its power of accessibility.
              Nothing is more fulfilling than being able to repackage previously inaccesible
              information for a new audience and make it understandable, 
              relatable, and if I'm lucky, actionable.  For that reason, I take a  
               human-centered approach in everything I do with dedicated user research,
              prototyping, system design, testing and iterating.  

              <br> <br>

              I'm also proud to say that I've designed and developed
              this site with my own blood,
              sweat, and tears. Although coffee, supermarket sushi (I'm not
              proud of it either), and long dramatic sighs had a
              significant hand in its creation. I can tell you all about it
              over some coffee. And perhaps sushi.
