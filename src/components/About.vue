             If the fedora-on-vacation look immediately
              gave you <i> "Designer with Roots in Marketing & Analytics
                 Committed to Making Digital Products You'd Actually Use" </i> vibes, 
              then look no further. My work here is done. For all the skeptics, 
              let me bring you up to speed on how I got here. 
        


              <br> <br>

              After two wonderful stints at 
              <a href="https://www.slate.com/"> Slate Magazine </a> and  
              <a href="https://www.wsj.com/"> The Wall Street Journal, </a>
              I finally had the  opportunity to shift my energy
               from the analytical to the creative at Parsons School of Design, where I recently 
               completed my <a href="https://www.newschool.edu/parsons/mps-communication-design/">
                masters</a> in Communication Design.

               <br> <br>

              To me, the magic of design lies in its power of accessibility.
              I treat design as a storytelling vehicle that can repackage 
              previously inaccessible information to a new audience: making it understandable, 
              relatable, and if I'm lucky, actionable.  For that reason, I take a  
               human-centered and strategic approach in everything I do with dedicated user research,
              prototyping, system design, testing and iterating.  

              <br> <br>

              I'm also proud to say that I've designed and developed
              this site myself. Although coffee, supermarket sushi (I'm not
              proud of it either), and long dramatic sighs had a
              significant hand in its creation. I can tell you all about it
              over some coffee. And perhaps sushi.
