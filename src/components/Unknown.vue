           Unknown is a hypothetical conference based in New York City
           that explores the ethics of future technology and design. 
           Our student group collaborated on a holistic branding 
           approach for the conference: from content strategy and promotion, to visual identity
          and interaction design.

       We were challenged to conceptualize and design a 
       conference brand would shed light on the 
       ethical and moral uncertainties we face in the 
       information era. However, conferences are dry by nature
       and often lack the ability to harness and retain its attendees' attention.

         <div class="six columns role mb4 ">
            In order to attract design & tech leadership in New York City, we
            chose to paint the conference in an edgy, yet 
            relatable light. The idea that no one really knows the effect 
            future tech will have on our society should be embraced with intrigue, 
            positivity, and adventure  - rather than fear of uncertainty. </div>

  The tone  of the conference is to demystify and
  shed light on <i> unknown </i> tech future ahead, so we wanted our brand 
  to reflect that exciting uncertainty.  We likened the content of the conference 
  to a light at the end of the tunnel, resassuring attendees that budding technologies are 
  something to look forward to, and that with them, a brighter future is out there.  For that reason, we 
  wanted to reference metaphors of light and pragmatism
  with bright, RBG colors and simplistic, repeating forms in our logo type, based on GT America.

      To build awareness and excitement, 
      we expanded UNKNOWN’s reach through 
      digital advertising and promotional screen based and OOH media.
      We tapped into platforms that would most likely be favored by UNKNOWN attendees 
      such as: WIRED Magazine, TechCrunch, Instagram, 
      street-style guerilla marketing, and more. Every piece of promotion included our
       punchy tagline, <i> "Design an Ethical Future" </i> - sure to catch the eyes 
       of technology and design leadership. </div>

          Our team chose the experimental venue, <a href="http://thelowline.org/"> Lowline NYC</a>, to further push the idea that there's a lot 
          more unknown to us than meets the eye. The Lowline (designed to rival its above-ground cousin The Highline), 
          is a pop-up underground garden powered by modern technology in NYC's Lower East Side. 
          The vibrancy of the collateral contrasts against darker spaces, reflecting the positive outlook we should take 
          when facing the unknown.

           guiding you through 
            the schedule, and archiving all video content. In particular, 
          users will keep returning to learn about their world

           around his or her world, the app will prompt them to uncover

         stories aggregate articles from tech and design focused publications, serving as a unique discoverability
