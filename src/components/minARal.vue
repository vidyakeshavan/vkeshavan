              MinARal is a single-player, augmented reality based scavenger hunt
              game for mobile devices that educates young users on the real-world
              use and purpose of gems and minerals. Proposed to The Smithsonian
                National Museum of Natural History, our student team wanted to
                use adventure via augmented reality and whimsy with our story to
                get children excited about the science of mineralogy.

               important goal for them is to promote STEM as an exciting 
               and viable career path for children. However, while the
               Gems & Minerals exhibit is one of the most popular in 
               the museum, some of the supplementary technology

              With only five weeks to iterate and present, our team knew that it would 
              be difficult to fully prototype an augmented reality experience for children through code. We opted 
              instead to represent our ideas with a demo reel, packaging our work as a ready-to-fund concept.

             clues, puzzles and mini games. Using AR in these quests, players

                the scope and general appearance, but not necessarily the

                sell itself in a demo reel, and ultimately encourage
