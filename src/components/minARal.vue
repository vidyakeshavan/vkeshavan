              NMNH’s Business Development team expressed that an
               important goal for them is to promote STEM as an exciting 
               and viable career path for children. However, while the
               Gems & Minerals exhibit is one of the most popular in 
               the museum, some of the supplementary technology 
               installed doesn’t seem like it was built with targeting 
               children in mind.

              With only five weeks to iterate and present, our team knew that it would 
              be difficult to fully prototype an augmented reality experience for children through code. We opted 
              instead to represent our ideas with a demo-reel, packaging our work as a ready-to-fund concept.

              Our team believed that the best way to engage kids in educational content, 
              such as the Gems & Minerals, was through a game. We chose to feature augmented reality technology 
             as the heart of the experience, making it fresh, exciting, and relevant to young visitors.

           Drawing from some of our favorites, we were inspired by the content themes found in 
           '90s computer game, <i> Where in Time is Carmen Sandiego?</i> and the 
           game functionality of AR based mobile game, <i> Pokemon Go!</i>.

            Through a discovery and collection process throughout the exhibit via an AR game, children will learn: 
            What kind of minerals exist in everyday objects around them (as well as the minerals found in cool stuff!) 
            And how those minerals are formed, harvested, and shaped to function in the way we need them to.
