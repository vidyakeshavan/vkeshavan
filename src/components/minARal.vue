              MinARal is a single-player, augmented reality based scavenger hunt
              game for mobile devices that educates young users on the real-world
              use and purpose of gems and minerals. Proposed to The Smithsonian
                National Museum of Natural History, our student team wanted to
                use adventure via augmented reality and whimsy with our story to
                get children excited about the science of mineralogy.

              NMNH’s Business Development team expressed that an
               important goal for them is to promote STEM as an exciting 
               and viable career path for children. However, while the
               Gems & Minerals exhibit is one of the most popular in 
               the museum, some of the supplementary technology 
               installed doesn’t seem like it was built with targeting 
               children in mind.

              With only five weeks to iterate and present, our team knew that it would 
              be difficult to fully prototype an augmented reality experience for children through code. <i> We opted 
              instead to represent our ideas with a demo reel, packaging our work as a ready-to-fund concept.</i>

              Our team believed that the best way to engage kids in educational content,

             clues, puzzles and mini games. </div>

              Depending on skill/age, players can accept quests from characters, building mineral-based objects from:

            a Cavewoman, found in the Human Origins exhibit:  helping her build a spear for her hunts.

                The NMNH relied heavily on our expertise to rapidly 
                ideate & develop concepts in a short amount of time. Our 
                ambitions were high, and our production timelines short, 
                so our prototype took the form of a <i> visual </i> one. 
                We chose this aesthetic type of prototype to capture
                the scope and appearance, but not necessarily the 
                final functionality, of our intended design.</div>
