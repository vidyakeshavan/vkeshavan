              NMNH’s Business Development team expressed that an
               important goal for them is to promote STEM as an exciting 
               and viable career path for children. However, while the
               Gems & Minerals exhibit is one of the most popular in 
               the museum, some of the supplementary technology 
               installed doesn’t seem like it was built with targeting 
               children in mind.

              With only five weeks to iterate and present, our team knew that it would 
              be difficult to fully prototype an augmented reality experience for children through code. We opted 
              instead to represent our ideas with a demo-reel, packaging our work as a ready-to-fund concept.
