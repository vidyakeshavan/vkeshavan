            phone-related time management issues.

         When I began this project in early 2018, I became increasingly aware of 
         the massive, media-fueled concern that our society is totally tech addicted. 
         Industry experts and parents alike made the case that if adults 
         feel this way about themselves, what does it mean for the teens and children who've never known 
         life without a device?

            <br> <br> 

            I began to investigate. What does addiction mean, really? What's causing 
            our society to feel this way - is it social media, or something much bigger than that?
              How can teenagers
              strike a better balance with their devices  - do the even <i>want</i> to?

          Wanting to hear from the source itself, 
          I organized a pool of 25 users made up of teenagers, 
          their parents, and their physicians. I asked the teens questions
          like, "Does your Instagram or Snapchat ever 
          stress you out? How do you cope with that stress?" I asked their parents questions like, 
          "How would you describe your child's relationship with their device - and yours?" and 
          health professionals whether their teen patients are "are usually forthcoming about stress 
          and where they think it might come from?".

                  find a small and effective way to solve this problem, Apple themselves
