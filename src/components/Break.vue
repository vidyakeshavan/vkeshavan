         When I began this project in early 2018, I became increasingly aware of 
         the massive, media-fueled concern that our society is totally tech addicted. 
         Industry experts and parents alike made the case that if adults 
         feel this way about themselves, what does it mean for the teens and children who've never known 
         life without a device? 

            <br> <br> 

            I began to investigate. What does addiction mean, really? What's causing 
            our society to feel this way - is it social media, or something much bigger than that?
              How can teenagers
              strike a better balance with their devices  - and do the even <i>want</i> to?

          Wanting to hear from the source itself, 
          I organized a pool of 25 users made up of teenagers, 
          their parents, and their physicians. I asked the teens questions
          like, "Does your Instagram or Snapchat ever 
          stress you out? How do you cope with that stress?" I asked their parents questions like, 
          "How would you describe your child's relationship with their device - and yours?" and 
          health professionals whether their teen patients are "are usually forthcoming about stress 
          and where they think it might come from?".

          Teenagers <i> were aware </i> of their excessive phone use, but
           also did not feel a pressing need to change their habits. Because phones allow young people a 
           form of agency they can't get at home with their parents' watchful eye, limiting phone use wasn't 
           in the cards for them.

                Instead, I found myself better understanding
            a need for change from the adults themselves. When asked what a healthy
            relationship with personal technology should look  like, common themes that came up in conversation were: <b> 
               Balance, Effiency, Promote Wellbeing, Timed Saved, and Convenience. </b> I found an that an 
               overwhelming amount of adults felt a codependency with personal technology and 
               instead wanted...to take a break from it. I began to shift my 
               focus onto a broader audience for which a <b> digital product that limited 
                  phone use </b> could truly be in-demand. If successful for adults, 
               teenagers who were willing to make habit changes could adopt the product themselves.

                 Of course, this is not the first time an effort to 
                 improve phone & time management has been made. Web based app
