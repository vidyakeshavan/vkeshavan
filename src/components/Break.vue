            break. is a mobile application I have been
            conceptualizing throughout my final semester at
            Parsons. This was conceived to help users monitor 
            their device use and encourage them break their 
            phone-related time management issues.

         When I began this project in early 2018, I became increasingly aware of 
         the massive, media-fueled concern that our society is totally tech addicted. 
         Industry experts and parents alike made the case that if adults 
         feel this way about themselves, what does it mean for the teens and children who've never known 
         life without a device?

            I began to investigate. What does addiction mean, really? What are the implications?
              How can teenagers
              strike a better balance with their devices  - do the even <i>want</i> to?
