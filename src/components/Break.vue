            phone-related time management issues through a customized
            reminder system.

         When I began this project in early 2018, I became increasingly aware of 
         the media-fueled concern that our society is tech addicted. 
         Industry experts and parents alike made the case that if adults 
         feel this way about themselves, what does it mean for the teens and children who've never known 
         life without a device?

            What's causing our society to feel this way - is it 
            social media, or something much bigger than that?
              How can teenagers strike a better balance with their 
              devices  - and do the even <i>want</i> to?

          I organized a pool of 25 users made up of teenagers, 
          their parents, and their physicians and asked them all to 
          describe their (or their child's/patient's) relationship with devices.          Teenagers <i> were aware </i> of their excessive phone use, but
          also did not feel a pressing need to change their habits. Because phones allow young people a 
          form of agency they can't get at home with their parents' watchful eye, limiting phone use wasn't 
          in the cards for them.

                Instead, I found myself better understanding
            a need for change from the adults themselves. When asked what a healthy
            relationship with personal technology should look  like, common themes that came up in conversation were: <b> 
               Balance, Effiency, Promote Wellbeing, Timed Saved, and Convenience. </b> I found most adults

          <i> break</i> was developed with four rounds of prototyping and testing from <a href="https://medium.com/major-studio-2-parsons-vk-2018/paper-prototypes-5cbaadd0b1fa">paper, to low-fidelity,</a>
                    <a href="https://medium.com/major-studio-2-parsons-vk-2018/prototyping-in-medium-fi-where-all-the-action-happens-f05fbc0d074b">medium-fidelty,</a> and high-fidelity. I focused on solutions and features that could
                    improve wellbeing by limiting the amount of time spent on devices. Within the first two rounds 
                    of prototpying and testing, I discovered that users thought their phone use was troublesome in the following scenarios:
                    <br> <br>
                    1. Right when they woke up and right before they fell asleep <br>
                    2. At Work or School <br>
                    3. Creating emotional stress from overwhelming social media or communication apps <br>
                    4. When they could have been chatting with friends or family face to face, rather than glued to their device <br>
                    5. When they were procrastinating or putting off doing something important <br>
                    <br>
                    I also found that several testers wanted accountability 
                    for their phone activity, but do the least amount of work to get to that goal. <br> <br>

                It's impossible to track time spent on each app 
                because there are no public APIs for tracking app use 
                on an iOS device. <a href="https://i.kinja-img.com/gawker-media/image/upload/s--3MRoVHwV--/c_scale,f_auto,fl_progressive,q_80,w_800/bscnob1vjft6h1chb7e8.jpg"> Moment iOS</a> 
                app aims to circumvent this, 
                but it requires users to take a screenshot of their device
                every day to help the app calculate time spent on each application. 
                 Instead, I chose to use the "phone unlock" as a metric that measured 
                time spent on a device. It is a simple and vague, yet powerful enough 
                of a measurement to inspire change. After an unlock, your phone would send you a reminder
                depending on your progress toward your time goal. <br> <br> Below is the basic  <b> user's journey: </b>

             Based on these principle features, I designed the <b> medium fidelity </b> 
             version of the concept with three distinct components: Onboarding, Insights, and Feedback. 
             When onboarding, the user will indicate why they want to cut down on phone use, how much
             they'd like to cut down by, and what time of day they typically spend on the device. 
             Over time, the phone measures the how often you unlock your phone and the time spent on the device once you do. 
            It then sends you reminders 
             with targeted copy at the time of day you wish to step away from your phone.
